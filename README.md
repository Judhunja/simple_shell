## About the simple shell project

The Simple Shell project is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with their computer by executing commands. It provides basic shell functionalities such as executing commands, handling input/output, and managing processes. The project aims to create a simple yet functional shell that can be used for various purposes.




## Getting Started

To get started with the Simple Shell project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple_shell.git

2. Build the shell by running the compilation command:
``gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell``

3. Run the shell:
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
### Output

-   Unless specified otherwise, your program **must have the exact same output** as `sh` (`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
-   The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your `argv[0]` (See below)

Example of error with `sh`:

```
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

Same error with your program `hsh`:
```
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
```

## Tasks

### 0. Betty would be proud
Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks

### 1. Simple shell 0.1
Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

-   Usage: `simple_shell`

Your Shell should:

-   Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
-   The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
-   The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
-   The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
-   If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
-   Handle errors.
-   You have to handle the “end of file” condition (`Ctrl+D`)

You don’t have to:

-   use the `PATH`
-   implement built-ins
-   handle special characters : `"`, `'`, `` ` ``, `\`, `*`, `&`, `#`
-   be able to move the cursor
-   handle commands with arguments

### 2. Simple shell 0.2
Simple shell 0.1 +
-   Handle command lines with arguments

### 3. Simple shell 0.3
Simple shell 0.2 +

-   Handle the `PATH`
-   `fork` must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

### 4. Simple shell 0.4
Simple shell 0.3 +

-   Implement the `exit` built-in, that exits the shell
-   Usage: `exit`
-   You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in `exit`

### 5. Simple shell 1.0
Simple shell 0.4 +

-   Implement the `env` **built-in**, that prints the current environment
>>>>>>> master
